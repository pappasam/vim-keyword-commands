1. INTRODUCTION~

This plugin makes it easy to write keywordprg commands. If you have a command
line program that you want to use as a keywordprg, this plugin will quickly
make that desire a reality.

2. CONFIGURATION~

*g:vim_keywordprg_commands*
Type: Dictionary[String, Union[String, List[String]]]
Default: defined in plugin/keywordprg_commands.vim

If you have a command line program that you want to use to look up keywords,
use this variable to configure it. The dictionary keys should be the names of a
Vim commands that you want to create; their values are printf-formatted string
representations of a command line program to associate with the Vim command
provided in the Dictionary key.

Example: dictionary lookups

Assume you want to look up the definition of an English word. If you have the
"dict" program installed locally along with the gcide dictionary, you can use
the following configuration to create a Vim command named "Def" to look up
English words: >vim

  let g:vim_keywordprg_commands = {
      \ 'Def': 'dict -d gcide %s',
      }

"%s" will be replaced by the word you pass as an argument to the command. To
look up the English definition for "cat", type: >vim

  :Def cat

Example: pydoc

Assume you want to use Python's "pydoc" utility to look up a Python keyword.
Additionally, you'd like pydoc's output (which is written in reStructuredText)
to be syntax highlighted. Use the following configuration: >vim

  let g:vim_keywordprg_commands = {
      \ 'Pydoc': ['pydoc %s', 'rst'],
      }

Notice that the value is not a string, but is instead of list of 2 strings. The
first list element represents the command line program (identical to our
dictionary example). The second argument provides an optional filetype to
associate with our documentation and take advantage of Vim's syntax
highlighting. Now, to look up Python documentation for "class" with beautiful
reStructuredText syntax highlighting, use the following Vim command: >vim

  :Pydoc class

*g:vim_keywordprg_ft_default*
Type: String
Default: ''

If, by default, you'd like to associate keywordprg commands with a particular
filetype, place your desired filetype in this configuration variable.

3. COMMANDS~

By default, this plugin creates the following keywordprg commands:

:DefEng                                                               *:DefEng*

  Look up a word's English definition using dict-wn

:SynEng                                                               *:SynEng*

  Look up a word's English synonyms using dict-moby-thesaurus.

:Pydoc                                                                 *:Pydoc*

  Look up a Python keyword using pydoc.

It is trivial to write your own. Feel free to submit a pull request with
anything useful keywordprg commands you come up with!

4. MAPPINGS~

This plugin provides no mappings of its own, but it is intended to be used
alongside Vim's built-in keywordprg. You should associate keywordprg commands
Vim's keywordprg configuration value. For the plugin's provided commands, this
can be done in your init.vim/vimrc as follows: >vim

  augroup custom_keywordprg
    autocmd!
    autocmd FileType markdown,rst,tex,txt setlocal keywordprg=:DefEng
    autocmd FileType python setlocal keywordprg=:Pydoc
  augroup end

For the above filetypes, if you type "K" while in normal mode, your keywordprg
command will be used to look up the word under the cursor. If you type "K"
while in visual mode, your keywordprg command will be used to look your visual
selection.
